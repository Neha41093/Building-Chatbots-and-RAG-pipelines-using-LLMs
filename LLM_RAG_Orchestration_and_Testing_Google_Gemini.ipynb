        "# RAG Orchestration and Testing for Internal Chatbot\n",
        "\n",
        "### ***Reference code file: Kaggle - RAGLab: An automated evaluation tool for configuring RAG pipelines***\n",
        "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful way for AI chatbots to leverage external data, giving them the ability to produce more accurate, context-rich responses. Instead of relying solely on a large language model’s internal knowledge, RAG applications retrieve domain-specific documents—often stored in a vector database—and feed them to the model as additional context. This approach is particularly helpful when building domain-focused chatbots in areas like law, medicine, or finance, where ensuring that responses reflect up-to-date, specialized information is essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "There are six major elements to the modular RAG process. Pre-retrieval, Retrieval, and Generation constitute the RAG pipeline (assuming a simple linear pipeline):\n",
        "\n",
        "- Indexing: Splits, structures, and transforms raw documents to enable efficient retrieval.\n",
        "    \n",
        "- Orchestration: Directs how each module interacts, controlling branching, scheduling, and flow.\n",
        "    \n",
        "- Pre-retrieval: Refines or expands the user’s query before any retrieval is performed.\n",
        "    \n",
        "- Retrieval: Searches the indexed data to find relevant chunks or documents.\n",
        "        \n",
        "- Generation: Produces the final response by leveraging a language model, using the query plus the refined context.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Judging: grades the output of the RAG pipeline against a supplied gold answer"

In summary those principles are: 1. Mere refusal of a \"Calderbank offer\" does not itself warrant an order for indemnity costs. In this connection it may be noted that Jessup J in Dais Studio Pty Ltd v Bullet Creative Pty Ltd [2008] FCA 42 said that (at [6]): if the rejection of such an offer is to ground a claim for indemnity costs, it must be by reason of some circumstance other than that the offer happened to comply with the Calderbank principle. 2. To obtain an order for indemnity costs the offeror must show that the refusal to accept it was unreasonable. 3. The reasonableness of the conduct of the offeree is to be viewed in the light of the circumstances that existed when the offer was rejected.', 'metadata': {'source': 'legal_text_classification (1).csv', 'row': 1}}\n"

            "{'page_content': 'Case445 followed Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 The \"public interest\" claimed by the ACCC to require protection of Category III documents from disclosure was said to be to encourage, by ensuring the confidentiality of information they provide, cartel whistleblowers to come forward. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [43] , the Court suggested in obiter dicta that such a public interest might exist. In the present case, Counsel for the ACCC put it this way: The public interest ... is to induce the Amcors of this world - those who come forward early, under the immunity policy - to give the fullest possible assistance to the [ACCC] to ensure that the cartel is put at an end as quickly as possible, prosecuted, and brought to finality quickly. The more assistance that Amcor gives the [ACCC] in that regard, the better the quality of the admissions and the evidence ... 28 Counsel for the ACCC conceded that confidentiality could not be absolute, in that both the ACCC and any potential whistleblower should reasonably expect that the whistleblower might have to testify in open court (ie, the whistleblower\\'s statements might ultimately come into the public domain). Nevertheless, counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that: (1) it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court; and (2) the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule. Without being able to rely on the confidentiality of statements not used in court, counsel for the ACCC submitted that whistleblowers might be dissuaded from coming forward and the public interest in rooting out cartel conduct correspondingly injured. 29 Regardless of whatever theoretical merit the argument may have (which I will address shortly), the force of the ACCC\\'s submission was undercut by the evidence of its own witness Mr Cassidy (the officer in charge of the leniency program for cartel whistleblowers) that in the present case Amcor did not seek confidentiality guarantees in its immunity application. In ACCC v ABB Power Transmission Pty Ltd [2003] FCA 626 at [44] , the Court suggested that the force of any public interest immunity claim will be vitiated where the independent witnesses cooperating with the ACCC did not even seek confidentiality. I agree. Moreover, even the broader factual merit of the claim is suspect, as the ACCC led no evidence that any cartel whistleblower, whether in this case or otherwise, has demonstrated reluctance to come forward based on a concern that information provided might become public. 30 The theoretical merit of the ACCC\\'s confidentiality contentions is even more deficient. A cartel claim, by definition, involves collusion between two or more actors. In the same way that it is both inevitable and self-evident that the statements of a cooperating criminal conspirator will be used against (ie, disclosed to) the non-cooperating conspirators, it must be taken for granted that a cartel participant contemplating a confession to the authorities knows, or should know, that his statements will be used by the authorities to prosecute the other party or parties. As such, the ACCC\\'s claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance. And without such a reasonable expectation, the ACCC\\'s contention that non-disclosure of the documents is required to protect the public interest cannot stand.', 'metadata': {'source': 'legal_text_classification (1).csv', 'row': 440}}\n",

And it also follows that no advice privilege inherently attaches to any documents (ie, the witness statements) summarizing those communications (which is not to say that privilege could never attach to copies or summaries of the communications depending on the purpose for which the copies or summaries were created: see Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501). Accordingly, a claim of advice privilege fails with respect to all three categories of disputed documents. 11 It is at this point that the doctrinal relationship between the advice and litigation branches of the privilege becomes relevant. As McLure JA noted in Leighton , the \" High Court has made numerous general statements which, on their face, are capable of applying to all categories of legal professional privilege, to the effect that the privilege only attaches to confidential communications \": Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [22] . In fact, some of those general statements can be fairly read to support the view that confidentiality is required for all categories of legal professional privilege. For example, in remarks quoted by Brennan CJ in Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 (at 508-09), Mason J stated in O\\'Reilly v State Bank of Victoria [1982] HCA 74 ; (1983) 153 CLR 1 at 22-23: But if communications in written form are to be privileged they must still be confidential communications between solicitor and client made for the purpose of advice or for the purpose of use in existing or anticipated litigation. Be that as it may, I agree with McLure JA that the High Court has never squarely confronted the issue, leaving the field open for lower courts to take opposing views. 33 Second, the \"free rider\" argument fails because it is, ultimately, founded on a theory of \"work product\" privilege not accepted in Australia. The work product doctrine, recognized by the United States Supreme Court, states that information or material prepared by attorneys reflecting attorney mental impressions, strategy, or other \"work product,\" even though not documenting lawyer-client communications or otherwise within the ambit of ordinary legal professional privilege, may be independently protected from discovery: Hickman v Taylor (1947) 329 US 495. The problem for the ACCC, however, is that work product is not recognized in Australia as an independent head of privilege: Commissioner of Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 570 (describing the US work product doctrine as part of general privilege law in Australia) (Gummow J); Leighton [2007] WASCA 151 at [17] (stating in Australia that the work product doctrine is recognised in the context of the litigation privilege). The ACCC itself has acknowledged this state of affairs: ACCC Position Paper, \"Review of Leniency Policy for Cartel Conduct\" (26 August 2005) at 19 n 21, available at http://www.accc.gov.au/content/item.phtml?itemId=725616&amp;nodeId=3a1faa8ec1e755f25adef02560676bf5&amp;fn=Leniency%20position%20paper.pdf (viewed 1 February 2008). 37 For the sake of completeness, I should first note Cadbury\\'s overall argument regarding the Category I documents. It was based on the fact that the copy witness statements retained by Amcor were just that - copies - and thus under Propend , their privilege status may differ from that of the original. To the extent that I have correctly understood the argument put by counsel, it misunderstands Propend . Propend established that the copy of a document may under some circumstances (ie depending on the dominant purpose for which it was created) be privileged even though the original is not privileged: Propend [1997] HCA 3 ; (1997) 188 CLR 501 at 508 per Brennan CJ, 543-544 per Gaudron J, and 554 per McHugh J. I do not, however, consider that Propend also establishes the converse; that is, the copy of a document may be unprivileged even though the original is. 38 Instead, I understand Propend to say that a copy of a privileged document will also be privileged unless the privilege has been expressly or impliedly waived (although it may be that allowing a copy to be made in certain circumstances is capable of being conduct constituting such a waiver, such as when a copy is made and communicated to a third party for purposes not related to legal advice or litigation): cf Spotless Group Ltd v Premier Building Pty Ltd [2006] VSCA 201 at [60] - [66] (noting that Propend left the issue open but concluding that whether a copy of a privileged document is privileged is distinct from whether privilege has been waived). As such, Cadbury\\'s argument, notwithstanding the way in which counsel sought to frame it, may be reduced to two questions: (1) are the documents privileged; and (2) has privilege been waived? 43 Against that background, I now turn to the question of waiver. Cadbury correctly notes that there is no evidence as to how or why copies of Category I documents were made and retained by Amcor or Amcor\\'s external solicitors. As noted earlier, Cadbury agitated this argument as a reverse Propend claim. It is, however, more properly understood as a waiver claim. That is to say, Cadbury appears to argue that although the original documents may have been created by or provided to Amcor under circumstances of confidentiality and even express claims of privilege, allowing Amcor to make or retain copies for its own use is conduct by ACCC inconsistent with its privilege claim.', 'metadata': {'source': 'legal_text_classification (1).csv', 'row': 450}}\n",

Nevertheless, counsel for the ACCC maintained that this expectation was not inconsistent with a reasonable expectation that statements provided to the ACCC will remain confidential because most cartel cases settle with the result that: (1) it never becomes necessary for witness statements of whistleblowers to be used in court; and (2) the entry into the public domain of witness statements of whistleblowers is the exception rather than the rule.

As such, the ACCC\\'s claim that a party like Amcor can have a reasonable expectation of confidentiality with respect to statements made to investigators is devoid of substance.

The primary purpose of an NDA is to protect sensitive information by restricting access to it and preventing its unauthorized disclosure to third parties. Specifically, an NDA accomplishes the following:  *   **Defines Confidential Information:** The agreement clearly identifies what constitutes \"confidential information,\" which may include trade secrets, proprietary data, financial information, customer lists, business plans, marketing strategies, technical specifications, inventions, and other non-public details. This definition is crucial for establishing the scope of protection.  *   **Establishes Obligations of the Receiving Party:** The NDA outlines the obligations of the party receiving the confidential information (the \"Recipient\"). These obligations typically include: maintaining the confidentiality of the information; using the information only for a specific, agreed-upon purpose; restricting access to the information to only those employees or agents who need to know it and who are also bound by confidentiality obligations; and taking reasonable measures to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure or use.  *   **Provides Legal Recourse:** An NDA provides the disclosing party with legal recourse in the event of a breach of the agreement. This means that if the Recipient discloses or uses the confidential information in violation of the NDA, the disclosing party can seek legal remedies, such as injunctive relief (a court order to stop the unauthorized use or disclosure) and monetary damages to compensate for the harm caused by the breach.  *   **Specifies Exclusions from Confidentiality:** While broad in scope, NDAs often specify certain exclusions from the definition of confidential information. Common exclusions include information that is already publicly known, information that was already in the Recipient's possession prior to disclosure, information that is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to the disclosed information, or information that is lawfully received by the Recipient from a third party without restriction.  *   **Defines the Term of Confidentiality:** The agreement will specify the duration for which the confidentiality obligations remain in effect. This term may be indefinite or for a fixed period of time, depending on the nature of the information and the parties' agreement.  | The purpose of a non-disclosure agreement is to ensure that confidential information remains protected.
